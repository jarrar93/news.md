* All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow.
* When you use JavaScript in
the browser, there is a part of
the browser that is called an
interpreter (or scripting engine).
* The interpreter takes your
instructions (in JavaScript) and
translates them into instructions
the browser can use to achieve
the tasks you want it to perform.

* In JavaScript we use console.log ('')
To write text that the user reads

* JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
HTML page. 

* When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
<script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

* You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.

* A variable is a good name for this
concept because the data stored
in a variable can change (or vary)
each time a script runs.

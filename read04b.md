* A computer is a device that contains electrical circuits that are programmed and added information to serve the users.

* How a computer works is that it receives information, stores it, then processes it, and then outputs it either as an audio or video file or anything that benefits the user.

* The computer only understands machine language, and stores information via electronic circuits .
* Zero and the one
It is understood by the computer, and we can access the computer by converting the decimal numbers to zero and one, and millions of information are stored in a format that the computer understands.
* A computer can receive billions of information within one minute.
* My opinion on the computer is that it is a miracle of this time and every time to come.

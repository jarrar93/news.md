1. # Foreground Color:

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any

color in CSS in one of three ways:

rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

hex codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: rad

 # Background Color
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page)


If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent. By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the <body> element.

# Example Styles :

Boxes : Width and height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images

Color
Italics, bold, uppercase,
lowercase, small-caps
Specific : There are also specific ways
in which you can style certain
elements such as lists, tables,
and forms.
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

1)Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.

2)Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.

3)External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

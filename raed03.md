# ch 17:
* For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
* When coding a site like this,
developers would usually put
these main sections of the page
inside <div> elements and use
the class or id attributes to
indicate the purpose of that part
of the page.
* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
